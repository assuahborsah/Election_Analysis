Election-Audit Summary

Colorado saw three counties tally up to 369,711 votes. The biggest of the counties with a 82.8% was Denver. We processed the votes for three candidates Charles, Diana, and Raymon. With 73.8% of the votes towards Diana DeGette, that is 272,892 of the 369,711 total votes.

The criteria for this election was for a popular vote, greater than or equal to 50.1%.

This script could be modified to run a check for a majority of votes, greater than or equal to 66.7% of the votes as the election criteria.

A second way is that weights could be assigned to the counties to represent the weights of the electoral college votes. With these proposals, perhaps the electoral commission could use this in the future to make adjustments, and the script could calculate almost any election.
